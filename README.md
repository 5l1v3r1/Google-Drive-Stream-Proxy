# Google-Drive-Stream-Proxy
> Alternative Google Drive Stream Script

The code is re-modified for the users to be able to understand the function of this script. Demo disabled due to transfer of hosting.

## Guide
- From the script, you can fetch the google drive id by this format `embed.php?id=` (Only the ID itself, not the url).
- You may place the file `stream.php` everywhere, it depends on how you will make it creatively.
- You can check the update logs [here](https://github.com/japnimedev/Google-Drive-Stream-Proxy/blob/master/LOG.md).
